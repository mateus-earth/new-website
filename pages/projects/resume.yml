Game Developer
Fire Horse Studio
Nov 2016 - Oct 2017 · 1 yr
São Paulo, Brasil
  I entered in the Fire Horse late 2016 as Game Developer.
  Being part of a outstanding team, I'm having the opportunity to work in amazing projects such:
    - Like a Boss
    - Fist Punch 2 for Cartoon Network
    - The Banner Saga 1 and 2 for Stoic Studio
    - Let them Come (AlienFx Game Maker integration).

  My responsibilities vary across the projects that I'm working (or worked) but mainly:

  - Fist Punch 2:
    Some additional programming to improve the game, like add keyboard navigation to Menus, change the way that localization stuff is structured and so on.
    In this project I did a lot of programming using NGUI and GSFU Unity plugins.

  - Like a Boss:
    Making a lot of small changes, code refactors, improvements, bug fixes and implementing new features.
    For Like a Boss I used NGUI, DOTween, GSFU. I also created some Editor scripts to ease some game development operations.

  - The Banner Saga 1, 2:
    I'm responsible to maintain and improve both games for Stoic Studio.
    The code base is enormous and it's a really pleasure to mess with.
    I do a lot of Action Script 3 programming and for versioning I use Mercurial.
    Besides the programming I'm also responsible for the build system.

  - Let them Come (AlienFx Game Maker integration):
    In this project I was responsible to integrate the AlienFx SDK to YoYo Games' Game Maker.
    The AlienFx SDK is written in C++ and provided as an DLL file, but it isn't readily usable in Game Maker.
    My job was write a binding that maps more 1:1 possible the C++ in GML (the Game Maker scripting language).
    It was very challenging since I had no experience in Game Maker at all, but at end we managed to get it right.

    I write some shell scripting to ease the studio day to day stuff and I wrote an texture packer algorithm to improve the performance of the particle system.

    At Fire Horse, we are very open to discussion, so now and then I give some opinions and insights about the game design, artwork, user experience, etc.


Creative Programmer
Imidiar Target Virtual
May 2015 - Mar 2016 · 11 mos
Santa Rita do Sapucaí, Brasil
  I rewrote Imidiar's Photo Totem completely from scratch and I was the co-creator of Imidiar's Hashtag Searcher.
  In the process of rewriting the Photo Totem, I brought a whole new perspective to the table and in end, we end using a lot of my ideas, ranging from very technical - like using Linux, and OpenCV - to very business oriented - like the new possible improvements, other business possibilities for it.
  The Hashtag Searcher I was involved in from the very beginning and I helped my partner develop the whole idea - from the "Wow, this could be nice" to the business plan - as well as programmed it alone.
